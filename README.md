Project Title: Home Credit Business Problem 

Description of business problem: Home Credit Business Problem Home Credit Company is a ﬁnancial institution with a passion to help marginalized unbanked population due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. The company was interested in providing a positive and safe borrowing experience to this group. In the process, the company had tried to predict their clients repayment abilities to make repayments by obtaining a variety of alternative data from telco and transactional information. Although the company is exploring data science methods, to use statistical and machine learning methods to make predictions, they were ﬁnding it challenging and needed help from data scientist like Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Benefits of a solution: When this company fully obtains the expertise or the means to apply statistical and machine learning methods to make predictions, they will be able to process accurate decisions to ensure that their clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful. Analytics Approach: A model to determine the probability of clients to default will be used for the evaluation and prediction of clients worthiness to obtain new loans. A supervised approach will be used to address the problem as classification. A classification model will be delivered on December 7.
